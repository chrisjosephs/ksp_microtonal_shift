# ksp_microtonal_shift
Kontakt Script - Overlaying note above playing note in range applies microtonal pitchshift with menu controls  

When you play sliced samples like beats for example in octave range C2 to C1 for example for the slices, this plugin allows you to play MIDI notes in the octave above set by the MIDI center note, and playing notes above the beats will pitchshift the MIDI note exactly according to the tuning.  This plugin additionally allowed EDO steps sizes other than 12.  If you also want to shift up or down an octave as well as to individual notes, then you can just use pitchbend +/- 12 alongside playing the notes
